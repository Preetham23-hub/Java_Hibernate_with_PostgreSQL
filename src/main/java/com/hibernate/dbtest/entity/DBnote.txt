 Student to Subject ---> Many to Many  --> Have to create a middle table to map foreign key of Student and Subject


For transcations

We get the session from the session factory  --> Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession()

we initiate the transaction --> transaction = session.beginTransaction();
we perform the action with the opened session -->  session.saveOrUpdate(subject);
we close the transaction -->   transaction.commit();


@Transactional handles transaction management for Spring Data JPA, but in raw Hibernate, you still need to manage transactions explicitly.
